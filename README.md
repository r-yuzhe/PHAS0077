# PHAS0077

The Code folder has all codes in this project

bash.zip is used to extract data from MASS (Big thanks Dr.Daniel Giles again) , he contributed some bash scripts. The extract.py is written by myself and others are his work

massdata.zip: MASS data  

data.zip: raw souning data

traindata.zip,xvalues.zip: created when running process.ipynb

x_mass.zip, MASSCAPE: processed MASS data and true CAPE


Two options:
1.unzip these zips which including data required in the same path as the codes

2.unzip the data.zip and run process.ipynb: traindata and xvalues can be obtained, run mass_cape:
MASSCAPE and x_mass can be obtained

In order to run these codes, some packages are required:

iris
tensorflow.keras
metpy  
dgpsi :https://github.com/mingdeyu/DGP


Thanks
